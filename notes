Subject: experience replay:
  - Goal: 1. Compare the performance of difference types of experience replay within multiple environments:
         - Start with these types: prioritised experience replay and hindsight experience replay.(HER=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01495.pdf)
         - Start with these environments: balancing a pole for now, put it within stijn's framework, start putting new environments into it.
         Why is this interesting? 
         - Experience replay is commonly used to avoid 'forgetting' old experiences and prioritizing only the new ones. Essentially, experiences
           are combined into one big bucket and shuffled up when training. A buffer of past experiences is used to stabilize training by 
           decorrelating the training examples in each batch used to update the neural network
